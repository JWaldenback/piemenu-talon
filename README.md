# PieMenu for Talon  
PieMenu is a contextual menu for use with a mouse.  
PieMenu has only been tested on Windows 10 with Talon Rust, on a single monitor.  

## Installation  
Clone the repo to "[Talon Home]/user"  
[Talon Home] can be found by navigating to Scripting>"Talon Home" in Talon.

## Using Pie Menu
Edit piemenu.talon to use your desired hotkeys.  
> By default, Pie Menu is triggered using the Right Streamdeck Foot Pedal  

Press and hold the hotkey to display the Pie Menu at your cursor.  
Move your cursor outward to the 'slice' of the Pie Menu with your desired action.  
> Slices extend outwards, beyond the drawn Pie Menu to the active screen's limits.  

Release the hotkey to trigger the indicated action.  

## Customizing Pie Menu

1. Add the settings and functions for your custom Pie Menu to a class inheriting from 'App_Specific_Vars' in 'piemenu_classes.py'
    >At the time of writing, functions called by PieMenu should take no parameters (other than self)
2. Add your custom class to the dict 'piemenu_variations' located at the bottom of 'piemenu_classes.py' 
- key = The name of the app where your Pie Menu should display (the result of talon.ui.active_app().name)  
- value = [Your_Menu_Layer_0(), Your_Menu_Layer_1,..,Your_Menu_Layer_N]  
    >If you want a custom menu without an associated app, add it to the list of values under "_default"  
3. Call the layer from your .talon file:  
```
    deck(pedal_right:down): user.piemenu_launch(1,0) 
    where: 
    piemenu_launch(screen_number: int, layer_number: int, toggle_mode: bool = False)
```
## Acknowledgements  
PieMenu was inspired by Blender's useful custom Pie Menus.
